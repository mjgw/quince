               These tests are not unit or regression tests.

This is because it is not possible to compare output from Image_Driver with an
expected "value" (i.e. is this graph equal to this graph). The problem is similar
to testing user interfaces.

The provided test "cases" are visual test suites that renders Image_Driver output,
the output should then be viewed and checked for inconsistencies on a visual base,
fx. this line chart does not show as _expected_, this gradient fill does not fill
to the edges of the area, the text does not align properly, etc.
